Babylon wages war on Babylon, Babylon vanquishes the evil of Babylon, Babylon falls and Babylon rises, The wars aren’t real but the genocides of your people are, How they massacre you like cattle! How god weeps for your misguided souls! Their merchants did trade, Their leaders wore their cross, Are you truly blinded by the serpent’s propaganda? Where did their scientists go?! You question where the bodies went, where do we put ours?
